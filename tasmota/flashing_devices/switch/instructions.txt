Example:

Send a MQTT message to cmnd/sonoff/EVENT ON and cmnd/sonoff/EVENT OFF

And the rules to listen to that could be:

rule 1
rule on EVENT#ON do power1 on endon
rule on EVENT#OFF do power1 off endon

(As this is just sending the command EVENT SOMETHING to your Tasmota, the limitation is that the first part need to be cmnd/[yourTOPIC]/EVENT)
